## Overview

The workshop invites papers for archival (proceedings) and non-archival tracks. Additionally, abstracts may be submitted to the non-archival track. The review process will be conducted on the Conference Management Tool (CMT). Each submission will be read by at least two reviewers, with a meta-reviewer making the final determination. Any accepted submissions will be included on the workshop website and can be presented as a poster at the workshop. Best submissions will be invited for virtual talks. A committee independent of the meta-reviewers will handle this decision.

## Submission requirements and instructions

Submission will be accepted on [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CV4E2024). The portal began accepting submissions July 1st. Reviews are double-blind. Specifications for archival and non-archival contributions are provided below. Appendices are acceptable and are not counted toward the page limits listed below. Reviewers are not required to review the appendices but may do so at their discretion.

**Proceedings (archival papers):** Use [ECCV standard formatting](https://eccv.ecva.net/Conferences/2024/SubmissionPolicies). Proceedings papers may be either short-form (7 pages) or full-length (14 pages).

**Non-archival papers and abstracts:** Submissions may span a range from a standalone abstract (1-3 paragraphs) up to full proceedings (archival) length (14 pages) and should follow [ECCV standard formatting](https://eccv.ecva.net/Conferences/2024/SubmissionPolicies). Relevant work accepted at other conferences within the previous 6 months may be submitted as non-archival contributions regardless of length and formatting.
