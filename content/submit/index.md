## Overview

The workshop invites papers for archival (proceedings) and non-archival tracks. Additionally, abstracts may be submitted to the non-archival track. The review process will be conducted on OpenReview. Each submission will be read by at least two reviewers, with a meta-reviewer making the final determination. Any submissions that is accepted will be included on the workshop website and can be presented as a poster at the workshop. Best submissions will be invited for virtual talks. This decision will be handled by a committee independent of the meta-reviewers.
