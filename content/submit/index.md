## Submit to CV4E at ICCV 2025!

The Computer Vision for Ecology workshop aims to bring together experts to foster discussion on the automation of ecological data collection, collation, and analysis.

Submission topics include, but are not limited to:
- Remote sensing  
- Bioacoustics  
- Video and image-based monitoring  
- Citizen science  
- Long-tailed recognition  
- Zero-shot learning  
- Expert AI systems  
- Robust model deployment

## Submission

The workshop invites papers for archival (proceedings) and non-archival tracks. Additionally, abstracts may be submitted to the non-archival track. The review process will be conducted on the Conference Management Tool (CMT). Each submission will be read by at least two reviewers, with a meta-reviewer making the final determination. Any accepted submissions will be included on the workshop website and can be presented as a poster at the workshop. Best submissions will be invited for virtual talks. A committee independent of the meta-reviewers will handle this decision.

## Submission requirements and instructions

### If you are submitting previously-published work, please make sure to check the dual submission guidelines of your original venue before submitting to our workshop.

Submission will be accepted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2025/Workshop/CV4E_Non-Archival). Reviews are double-blind. Specifications for archival and non-archival contributions are provided below. Appendices are acceptable and are not counted toward the page limits listed below. Reviewers are not required to review the appendices but may do so at their discretion.

**Proceedings (archival papers):** Use [ICCV standard formatting](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/AuthorGuidelines). Proceedings papers may be either short-form (4 pages) or full-length (8 pages). References are not counted toward the page limit.

**Non-archival papers and abstracts:** Submissions may span a range from a standalone abstract (1-3 paragraphs) up to full proceedings (archival) length (8 pages) and should follow [ICCV standard formatting](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/AuthorGuidelines). References are not counted toward the page limit. Relevant work accepted at other conferences within the previous 6 months may be submitted as non-archival contributions regardless of length and formatting.
