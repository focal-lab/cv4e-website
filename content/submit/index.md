## Overview

The workshop invites papers for archival (proceedings) and non-archival tracks. Additionally, abstracts may be submitted to the non-archival track. The review process will be conducted on the Conference Management Tool(CMT). Each submission will be read by at least two reviewers, with a meta-reviewer making the final determination. Any accepted submissions will be included on the workshop website and can be presented as a poster at the workshop. Best submissions will be invited for virtual talks. A committee independent of the meta-reviewers will handle this decision.

## Submission requirements and instructions

The submission will be accepted on [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CV4E2024). We will soon update the instructions for the paper submission. The portal will start accepting submissions from July 1st.
