Ben is an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming in the School of Computing and the Department of Zoology and Physiology. The focus of his work is designing and using computer vision tools to study ecological systems. He combines imagery from drones, fixed wing aircraft and ground-based cameras with deep learning driven software to detect and count individuals while quantifying their social and physical landscapes to understand animal populations and drivers of animal movement. Current and previous projects include using drones to study social dynamics of African ungulates and migrating sockeye salmon and landscape-scale aerial monitoring of pronghorn in collaboration with the Wyoming  Game and Fish Department.

Supervised by Devis Tuia (ECEO lab) and Anders Meibom (LGB lab), Jonathan's thesis is embedded in EPFL's Transnational Red Sea Center (TRSC), exploring how recent breakthroughs in machine learning and computer vision can be used to create the next generation of coral monitoring tools. Jonathan obtained his Master's in computer science from TU Berlin and his Bachelor's from the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, where his research focused on machine learning, compressed sensing, and computer vision.


### Justin Kitzes

Justin Kitzes is an Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, where he leads a research group focused on the development and application of automated acoustic survey methods in ecology and conservation. His work focuses specifically on the discovery of rare and hard-to-detect species, the use of machine learning models for species-level and within-species sound classification, and the creation of open-source tools and documentation to enable more widespread use of bioacoustics methods. Dr. Kitzes holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, Policy, and Management from the University of California, Berkeley.


### Amanda Navine
{{< figure src="headshots/Amanda_Navine.png" alt="Photo of Amanda Navine." class="portrait">}}
Amanda has studied the endangered native birds of Hawai'i since she arrived on Big Island to complete her master's degree in the Tropical Conservation Biology and Environmental Science Program at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo in 2019. Her research since graduating in 2021 has been working on using machine learning to advance passive acoustic monitoring of bird populations and improve management. She has collaborated with groups like Google DeepMind and Cornell Lab of Ornithology to improve the way we make ecological inference from machine learning classifier output.


## Expert panel

[View workshop recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjd816N8Z6o) (including panel discussion).

The panel discussion had a hybrid format, with some panelists presenting in person and others joining remotely. The panel discussed the challenges and opportunities in the field of computer vision for ecology and conservation, with a focus on *computer vision in the real world*.

 The panelists were:



### Anthony Hoogs
{{< figure src="headshots/anthony-hoogs.jpg" alt="Photo of Anthony Hoogs." class="portrait">}}
Dr. Hoogs leads Kitware’s Computer Vision group, which he founded when he joined Kitware in 2007. For more than two decades, he has supervised and performed research in various areas of computer vision including: event, activity and behavior recognition; motion pattern learning and anomaly detection; tracking; visual semantics; image segmentation; object recognition; and content-based retrieval. He has led dozens of projects, sponsored by commercial companies and government entities that range from basic, academic research to developing advanced prototypes, with a combined value exceeding $60M. In 2014 he served as an organizer of the National Academies National Research Council Workshop on Robust Methods for the Analysis of Images and Videos for Fisheries Stock Assessment, sponsored by NOAA, then joined the NOAA Automated Imagery Analysis Strategic Initiative Steering Committee.

### Toke Høye
{{< figure src="headshots/toke-hoye.jpg" alt="Photo of Toke Hoye." class="portrait">}}
I am a professor in ecology at Aarhus University, Denmark. I lead a research group focused on developing and applying novel monitoring technology to questions related to species responses to environmental change. We primarily focus on insects and other invertebrates, where monitoring data is particularly limited and where species responses to environmental change is particularly pronounced. We focus on computer vision methods, which are particularly promising for global scalability and expert validation. We collaborate widely in interdisciplinary projects.

<!-- ### Dan Morris
{{< figure src="headshots/dan-morris.jpg" alt="Photo of Dan Morris." class="portrait">}}
Dan Morris is a researcher in the Google AI for Nature and Society program, where he works on AI tools that help conservation scientists spend less time doing boring things and more time doing conservation. This includes tools that accelerate urban forest canopy assessments and image-based wildlife surveys.  Prior to joining Google, he directed the AI for Earth program at Microsoft, and prior to that he spent approximately a zillion years in the medical devices group at Microsoft Research, working on signal processing and machine learning tools for wearable devices that supported cardiovascular monitoring, fitness tracking, and gesture interaction.  He received his PhD from Stanford, where he worked on haptics and physical simulation for virtual surgery. -->

### Michael Berumen
{{< figure src="headshots/michael-berumen.png" alt="Photo of Michael Berumen." class="portrait">}}
Michael Berumen, Professor of Marine Science and Engineering, and has been managing the Red Sea Research Center, at KAUST King Abdullah University of Science and Technology Mike received a Zoology degree from the University of Arkansas in 2001. He then attended James Cook University in Australia to pursue graduate studies in coral reef ecology, specializing in life history and ecology of butterflyfishes. He was awarded the PhD in 2007. Mike accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where he focused on larval connectivity in coral reef fishes. During his time in Woods Hole, Mike began working in the Red Sea in 2008 in partnership with a new university in Saudi Arabia - the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Mike joined KAUST in July 2009 as a founding faculty member in the Red Sea Research Center. Mike has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed articles and 8 book chapters, and he has co-edited two books. His research focuses on advancing general understanding of Red Sea coral reefs and more broadly making contributions to movement ecology, which is a critical aspect of developing conservation plans in the marine environment. He is particularly interested in connectivity questions ranging from larval dispersal to large distance migrations of adult fishes.
