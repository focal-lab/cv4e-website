## Speakers


### Devis Tuia

<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/devis-tuia.jpg" style="left" height=150px/>
Devis completed his PhD at University of Lausanne, Switzerland, where he studied kernel methods for hyperspectral satellite data. He then traveled the world as a postdoc, first at University of València, then at CU Boulder and finally back to EPFL. In 2014, he became assistant professor at University of Zurich, and in 2017 he moved to Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where he was chair of the Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing Laboratory. Since September 2020, he is back to EPFL, where he leads the Environmental Computational  Science and Earth Observation laboratory (ECEO) in Sion. There, he studies Earth and biodiversity from above with machine learning and computer vision.


### Blair Costelloe
<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/blair-costelloe.jpeg" style="left" height=150px/>
Dr. Blair Costelloe is a behavioral ecologist interested in the collective and antipredator behavior of large African mammals. As an EU-funded Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, she led the HerdHover project to develop drone- and image-based methods for studying the collective behavior of animals in their natural environments. She is currently a principle investigator on the EU-funded WildDrone project, which aims to develop new drone and image-based tracking tools for wildlife conservation missions. Her research focuses on understanding the role animal behavior in driving broader-scale ecological processes. Blair is a Project Leader at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and the Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior at the University of Konstanz in Germany. She earned her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2014.

### Diego Marcos
<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/diego-marcos.jpg" style="left" height=150px/>
Diego Marcos is a tenure-track, junior professor at Inria Université Côte d'Azur in France, specializing in developing machine learning and computer vision methods to solve environmental and Earth observation problems. His research interests include creating more interpretable computer vision methods for species identification and building species distribution models using citizen science and Earth observation data. He holds a PhD from Wageningen University and an MSc in Computation Sciences and Engineering from EPFL in Switzerland.


### Hannah Kerner

Hannah Kerner is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. My research focuses on advancing the foundations and applications of machine learning to foster a more sustainable, responsible, and fair future for all. As the AI Lead for NASA's agriculture programs, NASA Harvest and NASA Acres, she is deploying research methods in real applications across the globe; her projects have directly resulted in optimized agricultural planning, disaster response, and financial relief in various regions around the world. The impact of Kerner’s research was recognized in Forbes 30 Under 30 and the International Research Centre On Artificial Intelligence's Top 10 projects solving problems related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals with AI.

## Expert panel

The panel discussion will have a hybrid format, with some panelists present in person and others joining remotely. The panel will discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field of computer vision for ecology and conservation, with a focus on *computer vision in the real world*. The panelists are:

<!-- - Michael Beruman, Red Sea Research Center, KAUST
- Erin Moreland, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -->

### Anthony Hoogs

<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/anthony-hoogs.jpg" style="left" height=150px/>
Dr. Hoogs leads Kitware’s Computer Vision group, which he founded when he joined Kitware in 2007. For more than two decades, he has supervised and performed research in various areas of computer vision including: event, activity and behavior recognition; motion pattern learning and anomaly detection; tracking; visual semantics; image segmentation; object recognition; and content-based retrieval. He has led dozens of projects, sponsored by commercial companies and government entities that range from basic, academic research to developing advanced prototypes, with a combined value exceeding $60M. In 2014 he served as an organizer of the National Academies National Research Council Workshop on Robust Methods for the Analysis of Images and Videos for Fisheries Stock Assessment, sponsored by NOAA, then joined the NOAA Automated Imagery Analysis Strategic Initiative Steering Committee.

### Toke Hoye
<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/toke-hoye.jpg" style="left" height=150px/>
I am a professor in ecology at Aarhus University, Denmark. I lead a research group focused on developing and applying novel monitoring technology to questions related to species responses to environmental change. We primarily focus on insects and other invertebrates, where monitoring data is particularly limited and where species responses to environmental change is particularly pronounced. We focus on computer vision methods, which are particularly promising for global scalability and expert validation. We collaborate widely in interdisciplinary projects.

### Dan Morris
<img src="./../../assets/media/headshots/dan-morris.jpg" style="left" height=150px/>
Dan Morris is a researcher in the Google AI for Nature and Society program, where he works on AI tools that help conservation scientists spend less time doing boring things and more time doing conservation. This includes tools that accelerate urban forest canopy assessments and image-based wildlife surveys.  Prior to joining Google, he directed the AI for Earth program at Microsoft, and prior to that he spent approximately a zillion years in the medical devices group at Microsoft Research, working on signal processing and machine learning tools for wearable devices that supported cardiovascular monitoring, fitness tracking, and gesture interaction.  He received his PhD from Stanford, where he worked on haptics and physical simulation for virtual surgery.
