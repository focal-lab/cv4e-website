This challenge aims to create AI models for classifying and detecting marine species using the FishNet dataset. It includes two tasks: predicting the speciesâ€™ family in classification and both identifying and locating species in detection, aiming to advance AI capabilities in marine biodiversity.

## Dataset

FishNet is a large-scale dataset consisting of more than 94,000 images. FishNet encompasses more than 17,000 species across 463 families. Compared to previous datasets, which often had a limited number of species, FishNet boasts nearly ten times more species. FishNet has an extremely long-tailed distri bution which poses a significant challenge for classification and detection tasks, as it requires models to effectively handle rare and underrepresented species.

## Submission evaluation

We will use the eval.ai platform to host the challenge. For Classification, we will use the accuracy metric on a private test set that will not be available to the contestants. We will provide train and validation splits from the FishNet datasets for the participants to develop their models. As for the Detection task, we will use the mAP metric on the held-out test set.
