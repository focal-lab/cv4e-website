The ECCV 2024 Challenge presents a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to showcase their expertise in fish species classification in challenging environments using the FishNet dataset. The challenge aims to address the complexities associated with classifying fish species in diverse and demanding conditions, while also tackling the inherent imbalance in the dataset, characterized by a long-tailed distribution.
## Dates:
- Dev Phase: Starts from May 10, 2024.
- Challenge Phase: Starts from July 10, 2024.
- Winner Announcement: September 5, 2024.

## Dataset

The FishNet dataset comprises a diverse collection of fish images captured in various environmental conditions, including underwater, low-light, and occluded scenarios. The dataset encompasses a wide range of fish species, from common to rare, contributing to its long-tailed distribution. Participants will have access to a large-scale annotated dataset for model training and evaluation.
